                    <p>
                        OASF employs robust security mechanisms, and only authorized personnel have access to 
                        your personal information. Online transactions are conducted on secure servers, with the 
                        information you provide encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Look for the green 
                        padlock icon in the browser's address bar and the website address beginning with "https" 
                        instead of "http."

                        even if your number is registered under DND/NCPR lists as per TRAI regulations.

                        affiliates, group companies, authorized agents, or third-party service providers. OASF and 
                        its third-party service providers may make calls and send SMS/emails through third-party 
                        platforms.

                        Except in the limited circumstances detailed below, OASF will not intentionally share your email

                                    third parties, we take significant measures to ensure they maintain the strictest 
                                    confidentiality. However, we cannot guarantee absolute privacy, as we do not have complete

                                    these agencies to carry out these activities on OASF's behalf.
